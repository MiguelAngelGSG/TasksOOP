# TaskPoo

WHAT DOES IT DO

This APP will allow the user with a simple text based interface to create a list of tasks where they can add, delete, list or markas completed the different tasks within this list. There is also an option to close the app itself.


HOW WAS IT DONE

This project took off where the last one was finished (Crud-JAVA) and modified it to use objects.
This simplified the main class and allowed a more organized code.
Creating the class TaskManager we used constructors to allow the different functions of this APP to be called to the main as objects.
